VeeR EL2
========

VeeR EL2 is a RV32IMC core supporting User mode and PMP. The core contains
a 4-stage, scalar, in-order pipeline.

Its configuration options include:
* AXI4 or AHB-Lite bus interfaces
* User Mode
* PMP, ePMP
* instruction and data closely-coupled memories with ECC

There are predefined configurations for simulation, FPGA and ASIC flows.

It's implemented in SystemVerilog on the Apache-2.0 license. You can find
the source code, documentation, tools for configuration and simulation
[in the VeeR EL2 repository](https://github.com/chipsalliance/Cores-VeeR-EL2).
