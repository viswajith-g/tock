# Netlify's own CI builds both deploy previews for PRs, as well as the
# production deploy for the master branch. We use this workflow purely as we
# can't have Netlify build the wildcard gh-readonly-queue/* branches. This
# workflow thus ensures that docs build successfully (albeit not in the exact
# same environment as Netlify's).

# See issue #3428 for more information.
