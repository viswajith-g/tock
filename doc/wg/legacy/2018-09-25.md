Updates: 15m
 - Milestones
 - UDP concurrency bug still live, meanwhile fixes to the UDP userland library
 - No progress on architecture

imix hardware update
 - 46 imixs:
 - 6 are completely functional
 - 2 are functional except sensors
 - 1 where sensors and debug don't work
 - 22 are fully functional except bluetooth
 - 14 basically not functional

1.2 bug update
 - Amit is on it
 - Phil suggests: sit down on a video call
 - Experience: when "if you have this line of code this works," can help pinpoint what changes about the binary

SenSys Tutorial: 15m
 - "Design Doc" here: https://goo.gl/ZR5z7M 
 - Assign IPv6 addresses from the unique 128-bit identifier associated with the flash.
 - Probably hash 128 bits down to 64, use that to generate 16-bit short MAC address, then use MAC to generate link-local IP address via: https://ben.akrin.com/?p=1347
 - What should the bug be?
 - The bug should be in userland
 - Maybe one of them just spins on the CPU?
 - Capsule could just reports timeslice expiration

Finalize Rng/Entropy: 15m
 - Summary: How do you generate random numbers?
 - Used to be asynchronous interface, but not clear what the width should be?
 - Design now: two separate groups of traits:
 - hil/rng for random numbers, and hil/entroy for sources of entropy. Random numbers are not necessarily entropy.
 - Best practices for traits with multiple callbacks (if we get to it): 15m
