//! Utility for creating non-volatile storage regions.

/// Allocates space in the kernel image for on-chip non-volatile storage.
///
/// Storage volumes are placed after the kernel code and before relocated
/// variables (those copied into RAM on boot). They are placed in a section
/// called `.storage`.
///
/// Non-volatile storage abstractions can then refer to the block of allocate
/// flash in terms of the name of the volume. For example,
///
/// ```ignore
/// storage_volume!(LOG, 32);
/// ```
///
/// will allocate 32kB of space in the flash and define a symbol `LOG` at the
/// start address of that flash region. The intention is that storage
/// abstractions can then be passed this address and size to initialize their
/// state. The default Tock linker script makes sure that the `.storage` section
/// is aligned on a 512-byte boundary and the next section is aligned as well.
