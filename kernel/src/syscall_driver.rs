//! System call interface for userspace processes implemented by capsules.
//!
//! Drivers implement these interfaces to expose operations to processes.
//!
//! # System-call Overview
//!
//! Tock supports six system calls. The `allow_readonly`, `allow_readwrite`,
//! `subscribe`, `yield`, and `memop` system calls are handled by the core
//! kernel, while `command` is implemented by drivers. The main system calls:
//!
//!   * `subscribe` passes a upcall to the driver which it can
//!   invoke on the process later, when an event has occurred or data
//!   of interest is available.
//!
//!   * `command` tells the driver to do something immediately.
//!
//!   * `allow_readwrite` provides the driver read-write access to an
//!   application buffer.
//!
//!   * `allow_userspace_readable` provides the driver read-write access to an
//!   application buffer that is still shared with the app.
//!
//!   * `allow_readonly` provides the driver read-only access to an
//!   application buffer.
//!
//! ## Mapping system-calls to drivers
//!
//! Each of these three system calls takes at least two
//! parameters. The first is a _driver identifier_ and tells the
//! scheduler which driver to forward the system call to. The second
//! parameters is a __syscall number_ and is used by the driver to
//! differentiate instances of the call with different driver-specific
//! meanings (e.g. `subscribe` for "data received" vs `subscribe` for
//! "send completed"). The mapping between _driver identifiers_ and
//! drivers is determined by a particular platform, while the _syscall
//! number_ is driver-specific.
//!
//! One convention in Tock is that _driver minor number_ 0 for the `command`
//! syscall can always be used to determine if the driver is supported by
//! the running kernel by checking the return code. If the return value is
//! greater than or equal to zero then the driver is present. Typically this is
//! implemented by a null command that only returns 0, but in some cases the
//! command can also return more information, like the number of supported
//! devices (useful for things like the number of LEDs).
//!
//! # The `yield` system call class
//!
//! While drivers do not handle `yield` system calls, it is important
//! to understand them and how they interact with `subscribe`, which
//! registers upcall functions with the kernel. When a process calls
//! a `yield` system call, the kernel checks if there are any pending
//! upcalls for the process. If there are pending upcalls, it
//! pushes one upcall onto the process stack. If there are no
//! pending upcalls, `yield-wait` will cause the process to sleep
//! until a upcall is triggered, while `yield-no-wait` returns
//! immediately.
//!
//! # Method result types
//!
//! Each driver method has a limited set of valid return types. Every
//! method has a single return type corresponding to success and a
//! single return type corresponding to failure. For the `subscribe`
//! and `allow` system calls, these return types are the same for
//! every instance of those calls. Each instance of the `command`
//! system call, however, has its own specified return types. A
//! command that requests a timestamp, for example, might return a
//! 32-bit number on success and an error code on failure, while a
//! command that requests time of day in microsecond granularity might
//! return a 64-bit number and a 32-bit timezone encoding on success,
//! and an error code on failure.
//!
//! These result types are represented as safe Rust types. The core
//! kernel (the scheduler and syscall dispatcher) is responsible for
//! encoding these types into the Tock system call ABI specification.

    /// kernel needs the capsule to initiate the allocation because only the

    /// If a capsule fails to successfully implement this function, subscribe

    //
    // The inclusion of this function originates from the method for ensuring
    // correct upcall swapping semantics in the kernel starting with Tock 2.0.
    // To ensure upcalls are always swapped correctly all upcall handling is
    // done in the core kernel. Capsules only have access to a handle which
    // permits them to schedule upcalls, but capsules no longer manage upcalls.
    //
    // The core kernel stores upcalls in the process's grant region along with
    // the capsule's grant object. A simultaneous Tock 2.0 change requires that
    // capsules wishing to use upcalls must also use grants. Storing upcalls in
    // the grant requires that the grant be allocated for that capsule in that
    // process. This presents a challenge as grants are dynamically allocated
    // only when actually used by a process. If a subscribe syscall happens
    // first, before the capsule has allocated the grant, the kernel has no way
    // to store the upcall. The kernel cannot allocate the grant itself because
    // it does not know the type T the capsule will use for the grant (or more
    // specifically the kernel does not know the size of T to use for the memory
    // allocation).
    //
    // There are a few ideas on how to handle this case where the kernel must
    // store an upcall before the capsule has allocated the grant.
    //
    // 1. The kernel could allocate space for the grant type T, but not actually
    //    initialize it, based only on the size of T. However, this would
    //    require the kernel to keep track of the size of T for each grant, and
    //    there is no convenient place to store that information.
    //
    // 2. The kernel could store upcalls and grant types separately in the grant
    //    region.
    //
    //    a. One approach is to store upcalls completely dynamically. That is,
    //       whenever a new subscribe_num is used for a particular driver the
    //       core kernel allocates new memory from the grant region to store it.
    //       This would work, but would have high memory and runtime overhead to
    //       manage all of the dynamic upcall stores.
    //    b. To reduce the tracking overhead, all upcalls for a particular
    //       driver could be stored together as one allocation. This would only
    //       cost one additional pointer per grant to point to the upcall array.
    //       However, the kernel does not know how many upcalls a particular
    //       driver needs, and there is no convenient place for it to store that
    //       information.
    //
    // 3. The kernel could allocate a fixed region for all upcalls across all
    //    drivers in the grant region. When each grant is created it could tell
    //    the kernel how many upcalls it will use and the kernel could easily
    //    keep track of the total. Then, when a process's memory is allocated
    //    the kernel would reserve room for that many upcalls. There are two
    //    issues, however. The kernel would not know how many upcalls each
    //    driver individually requires, so it would not be able to index into
    //    this array properly to store each upcall. Second, the upcall array
    //    memory would be statically allocated, and would be wasted for drivers
    //    the process never uses.
    //
    //    A version of this approach would assume a maximum limit of a certain
    //    number of upcalls per driver. This would address the indexing
    //    challenge, but would still have the memory overhead problem. It would
    //    also limit capsule flexibility by capping the number of upcalls any
    //    capsule could ever use.
    //
    // 4. The kernel could have some mechanism to ask a capsule to allocate its
    //    grant, and since the capsule knows the size of T and the number of
    //    upcalls it uses the grant type and upcall storage could be allocated
    //    together.
    //
    // Based on the available options, the Tock developers decided go with
    // option 4 and add the `allocate_grant` method to the `Driver` trait. This
    // mechanism may find more uses in the future if the kernel needs to store
    // additional state on a per-driver basis and therefore needs a mechanism to
    // force a grant allocation.
    //
    // This same mechanism was later extended to handle allow calls as well.
    // Capsules that do not need upcalls but do use process buffers must also
    // implement this function.
