//! Data structure for storing compile-time configuration options in the kernel.
//!
//! The rationale for configuration based on a `const` object is twofold.
//!
//! - In theory, Cargo features could be used for boolean-based configuration.
//!   However, these features are generally error-prone for non-trivial use
//!   cases. First, they are globally enabled as long as a dependency
//!   relationship requires a feature (even for other dependency relationships
//!   that do not want the feature). Second, code gated by a non-enabled feature
//!   isn't even type-checked by the compiler, and therefore we can end up with
//!   broken features due to refactoring code (if these features aren't tested
//!   during the refactoring), or to incompatible feature combinations.
//!
//! - Cargo features can only contain bits. On the other hand, a constant value
//!   can contain arbitrary types, which allow configuration based on integers,
//!   strings, or even more complex values.
//!
//! With a typed `const` configuration, all code paths are type-checked by the
//! compiler - even those that end up disabled - which greatly reduces the risks
//! of breaking a feature or combination of features because they are disabled
//! in tests.
//!
//! In the meantime, after type-checking, the compiler can optimize away dead
//! code by folding constants throughout the code, so for example a boolean
//! condition used in an `if` block will in principle have a zero cost on the
//! resulting binary - as if a Cargo feature was used instead. Some simple
//! experiments on generated Tock code have confirmed this zero cost in
//! practice.

    // limitations in Rust (as of Sep 2021) that does not happen if the
    // functions are part of a trait (see
    // https://github.com/tock/tock/issues/2594).

    // have only been moderately successful (see
    // https://github.com/tock/tock/pull/2826 and

    // is identified, using configuration constants is the most effective
