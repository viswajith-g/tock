//! # TicKV
//!
//! TicKV (Tiny Circular Key Value) is a small file system allowing
//! key value pairs to be stored in Flash Memory.
//!
//! TicKV was written to allow the Tock OS kernel to persistently store app data
//! on flash. It was written to be generic though, so other Rust applications can
//! use it if they want.
//!
//! TicKV is based on similar concepts as
//! [Yaffs1](https://yaffs.net/documents/how-yaffs-works]).
//!
//! ## Goals of TicKV
//!
//! TicKV is designed with these main goals (in order)
//!
//!  * Fully implemented in no_std Rust
//!  * Power loss resilient
//!  * Maintain data integrity and detect media errors
//!  * Wear leveling
//!  * Low memory usage
//!  * Low storage overhead
//!  * No external crates in use (not including unit tests)
//!
//! TicKV is also designed with some assumptions
//!
//!  * Most operations will be retrieving keys
//!  * Some operations will be storing keys
//!  * Keys will rarely be deleted
//!  * Key values will rarely need to be modified
//!
//! ## ACID characteristics
//!
//! TicKV provides ACID properties. For the purpose of ACID a transaction is a
//! key operation, that is finding, adding, invalidating or fully removing
//! (garbage collection) a key.
//!
//! To provide ACIS characteristics TicKV requires that the `FlashController`
//! implementation complete all transactions in a single operation. That is the
//! flash `write()` function must either successfully write all of the data or
//! none. If the implementation completes a partial operation, then the Atomicity
//! and Consistency traits will be lost. If the implementation reports completion
//! when the data hasn't been written yet, then the Isolation trait will be lost.
//!
//! Atomicity: TicKV guarantees that all operations are treated as a single unit
//! inside the implementation. The database will be left unchanged if a
//! transaction fails.
//!
//! Consistency: Consistency is maintained similar to atomicity. All operations
//! can only take the database from a valid state to another valid state.
//!
//! Isolation: TicKV only allows a single operation at a time. In this way it
//! provides isolation. The layer above TicKV is responsible for handling
//! concurrent accesses by deferring operations for example.
//!
//! Durability: TicKV ensures durability and once a transaction has completed
//! and been committed to flash it will remain there.
//!
//! ## Using TicKV
//!
//! See the generated Rust documentation for details on using this in your project.
//!
//! ## How TicKV works
//!
//! Unlike a regular File System (FS) TicKV is only designed to store Key/Value (KV)
//! pairs in flash. It does not support writing actual files, directories or other
//! complex objects. Although a traditional file system layer could be added on top
//! to add such features.
//!
//! TicKV allows writing new key/value pairs (by appending them) and removing
//! old key/value pairs.
//!
//! TicKV has two important types, regions and objects.
//!
//! A TicKV region is the smallest region of the flash memory that can be erased
//! in a single command.
//!
//! TicKV saves and restores objects from flash. TicKV objects contain the value
//! the user wanted to store as well as extra header data. Objects are internal to
//! TicKV and users don't need to understand them in detail to use it.
//!
//! For more details on the technical implementation see the [SPEC.md](./spec.md) file.
//!
//! # Using TicKV
//!
//! To use TicKV first you need to implemented the `FlashCtrl` trait. The
//! example below is for 1024 byte region sizes.
//!
//! Then you will need to create a TicKV implementation.
//!
//!
//! ```rust
//! // EXAMPLE ONLY: The `DefaultHasher` is subject to change
//! // and hence is not a good fit.
//! use std::collections::hash_map::DefaultHasher;
//! use std::hash::{Hash, Hasher};
//! use std::cell::RefCell;
//! use tickv::{TicKV, MAIN_KEY};
//! use tickv::error_codes::ErrorCode;
//! use tickv::flash_controller::FlashController;
//!
//! fn get_hashed_key(unhashed_key: &[u8]) -> u64 {
//!     let mut hash_function = DefaultHasher::new();
//!     unhashed_key.hash(&mut hash_function);
//!     hash_function.finish()
//! }
//!
//! struct FlashCtrl {
//!     buf: RefCell<[[u8; 1024]; 64]>,
//! }
//!
//! impl FlashCtrl {
//!     fn new() -> Self {
//!         Self {
//!             buf: RefCell::new([[0xFF; 1024]; 64]),
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! impl FlashController<1024> for FlashCtrl {
//!     fn read_region(&self, region_number: usize, buf: &mut [u8; 1024]) -> Result<(), ErrorCode> {
//!         // TODO: Read the specified flash region
//!         for (i, b) in buf.iter_mut().enumerate() {
//!             *b = self.buf.borrow()[region_number][i]
//!         }
//!         Ok(())
//!     }
//!
//!     fn write(&self, address: usize, buf: &[u8]) -> Result<(), ErrorCode> {
//!         // TODO: Write the data to the specified flash address
//!         for (i, d) in buf.iter().enumerate() {
//!             self.buf.borrow_mut()[address / 1024][(address % 1024) + i] = *d;
//!         }
//!         Ok(())
//!     }
//!
//!     fn erase_region(&self, region_number: usize) -> Result<(), ErrorCode> {
//!         // TODO: Erase the specified flash region
//!         Ok(())
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! let mut read_buf: [u8; 1024] = [0; 1024];
//!
//! let mut hash_function = DefaultHasher::new();
//! MAIN_KEY.hash(&mut hash_function);
//!
//! let tickv = TicKV::<FlashCtrl, 1024>::new(FlashCtrl::new(),
//!                   &mut read_buf, 0x1000);
//! tickv
//!    .initialise(hash_function.finish())
//!    .unwrap();
//!
//! // Add a key
//! let value: [u8; 32] = [0x23; 32];
//! tickv.append_key(get_hashed_key(b"ONE"), &value).unwrap();
//!
//! // Get the same key back
//! let mut buf: [u8; 32] = [0; 32];
//! tickv.get_key(get_hashed_key(b"ONE"), &mut buf).unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! You can then use the `get_key()` function to get the key back from flash.
//!
//! # Collisions
//!
//! TicKV will prevent a new key/value pair with a colliding hash of the key to be
//! added. The collision will be reported to the user with the `KeyAlreadyExists`
//! `ErroCode`.
//!
//! # Power loss protection
//!
//! TicKV ensures that in the event of a power loss, no stored data is lost or
//! corrupted. The only data that can be lost in the event of a power loss is
//! the data currently being written (if it hasn't been write to flash yet).
//!
//! If a power loss occurs after calling `append_key()` or `invalidate_key()`
//! before it has completed then the operation probably did not complete and
//! that data is lost.
//!
//! To help reduce this time to be as short as possible the `FlashController`
//! is synchronous. Although flash writes can take a considerable amount of time
//! and this will stall the application, this still seems like a good idea
//! to avoid loosing data.
//!
//! # Security
//!
//! TicKV uses check sums to check data integrity. TicKV does not have any measures
//! to prevent malicious manipulation or privacy. An attacker with access to the
//! flash can change the values without being detected. An attacked with access
//! to flash can also read all of the information. Any privacy, security or
//! authentication measures need to be layered on top of TicKV.
//!
//! ## Versions
//!
//! TicKV stores the version when adding objects to the flash storage.
//!
//! TicKV is currently version 0.
//!
//!  * Version 0
//!    * Version 0 is a draft version. It should NOT be used for important data!
//!      Version 0 maintains no backwards compatible support and could change at
//!      any time.
